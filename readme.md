# Singapore Transportation Data Visualization Project

## Introduction
This GitHub repository hosts a data visualization project that analyzes Singapore's transportation data, specifically focusing on bus and train information. We utilize various Python libraries such as Seaborn, Plotly, Dash, and Pandas to explore, visualize, and gain insights from the data.

## Bus Data Analysis
### Objective
The Singapore government has allocated a $200 million subsidy to bus operators to mitigate the impact of fare increases on commuters. The objective of this analysis is to determine the best way to allocate this subsidy based on the following factors:

### Aims for Graphs:
1. **Variety of Bus Services:** Identify which bus operator offers a greater variety of bus services to the public.
2. **Number of Buses:** Determine which bus operator has the highest number of buses overall.
3. **Coverage of Bus Stops:** Find which operator services more bus stops, contributing to better connectivity across Singapore.

To achieve these aims, we perform an in-depth analysis of bus data, exploring operator diversity, fleet size, and stop coverage.

## Train Data Analysis
### Objective
With the development of lines such as the Thomson East Coast Line, Cross Island Line, and Circle Line, the Singapore government aims to enhance the public transportation network. This analysis focuses on identifying the areas where the government should prioritize these new lines based on the potential benefits to commuters.

### Aims for Graphs:
1. **Station Grouping:** Visualize how train stations are grouped for analysis.
2. **Exploratory Analysis:** Gain insights into the distribution of stations and potential benefits of new lines.
3. **Interactive Comparison:** Provide an interactive way to compare the importance of different train lines.

We aim to help stakeholders make informed decisions regarding the expansion and prioritization of new train lines for the benefit of the community.

## Code Overview
The code for this project is implemented in Python and utilizes the following libraries:

- `pandas`: For data manipulation and analysis.
- `seaborn`: For creating informative and attractive statistical graphics.
- `plotly`: For interactive and expressive data visualizations.
- `dash`: For building interactive web applications to present data insights.


## Conclusion
This project aims to provide valuable insights into Singapore's transportation system using data visualization techniques. Feel free to explore the code, data, and visualizations to better understand the factors influencing public transportation in Singapore.
